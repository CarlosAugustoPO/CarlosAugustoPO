## Hello, welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a Personal Trainer, Master in Health Sciences, autodidact, passionate about linux, programming and technology in general.
- One of my hobbies, since i was 16y, is create, clone, explore, test, modify and debug softwares while looking to further improve my development skills. 
- Currently my biggest project is the <a href='https://www.plataformadetreinos.com.br'>*Plataforma de Treinos*</a> (Training Platform), an online gym, with personalized exercise programs. 
- Curiosity about me: I'm not stuck with the codes I've already written. I erase without mercy.
- Fun Fact: Dotfiles are another passion that make me lose sleep and spend days procrastinating, if you know about a support group for that purpose, I wold try an intervention. 
- Please feel free to get in touch and ask anything you want, I am usually willing to answer pertinent questions.
